Each news item contains:

```json
{
  "title": "India's space program launches new satellite",
  "summary": "The satellite is expected to improve communication services.",
  "published": "Mon, 20 May 2025 08:00:00 GMT",

}
```

## 🧠 How It Works

- `news_scraper.py`: Main script that loads RSS feeds, fetches and parses articles, and stores output.
- `helpers.py`: Utility functions to clean text and detect the language of article titles using `langdetect`.

---

## 🧪 Optional Enhancements

- Add support for scheduling via `cron` or `APScheduler`
- Integrate Flask/Django to serve results via API
- Store data in a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Add keyword filters, categories, or sentiment analysis
